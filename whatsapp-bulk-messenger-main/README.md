The "Whatsapp Bulk Messages Sender With Python" is a Python script that allows users to send bulk WhatsApp messages for marketing purposes without requiring an API. To use the script, users need to install the "selenium" and "webdriver_manager" packages. They can then write the message in the "message.txt" file and add recipient numbers in the "numbers.txt" file. Optionally, users can modify certain configurations in the "main.py" file. After running the script, a WhatsApp login page will open, and the sending process will begin.
